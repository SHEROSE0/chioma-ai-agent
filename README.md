# Arbitra AI Agent

An intelligent AI agent powering the Arbitra on-chain arbitration and escrow protocol.

The Arbitra AI Agent enables parties in two-sided agreements to automate escrow coordination, dispute resolution, contract analysis, and settlement workflows through natural language interactions.

Built for the Arbitra platform and designed to integrate with the Stellar blockchain and Soroban smart contracts, the agent combines conversational AI, arbitration intelligence, contract automation, and blockchain integration into a single assistant that works across verticals — rentals, freelance agreements, trade finance, insurance claims, and more.
